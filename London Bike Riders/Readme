## 📊 Project Overview

The London Bike Rides project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization using a dataset of bike rentals. The goal is to:

- Understand how bike demand varies by hour, season, temperature, and humidity.
- Visualize key patterns using Tableau dashboards.
- Provide insights to inform urban transportation policies.
